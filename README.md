# MVC Tech Blog

## Description
This is a web application where users can make and see tech-related posts and comment on them. Users can see existing posts without a login, but a login is required in order to comment, or to create, edit, or delete posts. Once logged in, a user can see all of their posts on their dashboard. From there, they can create new posts, edit their past posts, or delete their posts. Logged in users can also comment on other posts by navigating to the home page, clicking on a post, and then adding a comment from that selected post's page.
